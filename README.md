Occupant's Health Monitoring Inside the Autonomous Vehicle

This project monitors the occupant's health inside an autonomous vehicle by:
1. Continuously capturing frames from a camera to detect emotions.
2. Analyzing heart rate data obtained from a smartwatch.
3. Triggering emergency alerts to a designated mobile number if:
     The detected emotion is sad, fear, or angry.
     The heart rate is abnormal (bpm < 70 or bpm > 110).

Prerequisites: 
1. Smartwatch (should support heart rate data export or real-time monitoring)  
2. Heart rate data source: HTML file exported from the smartwatchâ€™s mobile application
3. Twilio API account for sending emergency alerts.
4. Twilio Credentials (replace these in vehicle_dashboard.py):
     TWILIO_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER, TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER(your phone number)
